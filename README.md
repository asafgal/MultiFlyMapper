# MultiFlyMapper
Code and sample implementation for quantifying behavior in fly pairs as described in "An Unsupervised Method for Quantifying the Behavior of Paired Animals" 

Ugne Klibaite, 2016

This repository contains all functions necessary to replicate the analysis in the paper and a very general 
outline of the process in 'MultiFlyPipeline.m'

The repo is under construction and will be updated shortly with a sample map and more visualization code for a full
working example (behavioral movie -> alignment -> projections -> embedding -> densities -> transition calculations). 

For examples of single-fly behavior quantification and sources please refer to https://github.com/gordonberman/MotionMapper
